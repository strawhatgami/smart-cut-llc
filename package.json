  "description": "This script is to pair with Losslesscut, it allows to add a \"smart cut\" feature to the software:\n1/ Do the cuts of your video in Losslesscut as usual, just don't export the videos you want.\n2/ Locate the Losslesscut project file the software generated (export it if needed), then run sth like: 'node adjust-key-frames.js <project.llc>'.\nThis will generate two files: a new video and a new .llc file.\n4/ Import the new .llc (something like project-adjusted-keys.llc) in Losslesscut, and export the cuts: the keyframes are at the right places to do smart cuts of your cuts.\n\nDon't forget to install the json5 dependency with 'npm install' before using this script ;-)",
